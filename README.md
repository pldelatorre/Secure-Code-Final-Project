# Reflection:
## 1. Identify any challenges or issues you encountered while writing your functions.
- Creating the functions with the docstrings is useful but takes a long time to make
- Using a try and except block inside a function still confuses me somehow
- One issue I had trouble with is not meeting the output that I need because of some of the renaming of the functions in the chatbot line of code
## 2. Discuss the benefits and challenges of developing and using unit tests.
- It helps you test functions in a way that you can anticipate possible exceptions
- It helps you know if your function works the way you intend for it to work
- A challenge in using unit test is looking at a long lines of codes is pretty difficult and a small missing period can fail your test immediately
